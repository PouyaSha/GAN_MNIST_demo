# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on MNIST  

This repository contains a simple PyTorch implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** trained on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.  
It is designed for learning and demonstration purposes, with clear step-by-step explanations.

## Features  
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset  
- Implements a **Generator** and **Discriminator** in PyTorch  
- Trains with the **adversarial loss (minimax game)**  
- Saves generated samples at different epochs  
- Creates a **GIF animation** of the generatorâ€™s progress during training
